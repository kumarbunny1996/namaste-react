# REACT-INCEPTION

browser doesnt know the react code

`cdn links` are content deleivery network where the react like frameworks are hosted in the websites we are pulling from there to our project

`crossorigin` attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS request to load resources(e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts)on other servers

`viewport` attribute in meta tag use to control the width and scaling of the viewport so that it is sized correctly on all devices

`React` file which contains core algorithm of react framework

`ReactDOM` file for operations of dom - `document object modal`

most expensive operation in browser is dom manipulation based on user interaction

`React.createElement()` gives react object not htm element which the react render method converts the react object to the html which browser understands

React is a `library` not a framework which can used for specific code minimal javascript code
React can used in existing app also by injecting cdn links
